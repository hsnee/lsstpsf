The main code for replicating analysis in the paper is in CSAB.py. 

Most of the other notebooks are either: 
* exploratory notebooks
* notebooks that run parts of the code
* notebooks that make 1 calculation for an ad-hoc thing in the paper
* notebooks that generate plots for the paper. 

Most of the other files are either post-processings of OpSim runs or pickled results.
